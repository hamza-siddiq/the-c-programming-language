# The C Programming Language by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie
To learn the C programming language, I started reading both the first and second version of the C programming language. I did the problems from the first version, since I found them more challenging.

To get a better understanding of my coding abilities, I recommend that you start from chapter 8, and go back from there, since there is a lot that I improved on as I progressed.
