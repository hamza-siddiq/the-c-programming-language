# the-c-programming-language
To learn the C programming language, I started reading both the first and second version of the C programming language. I did the problems from the first version, since I found them more challenging. I am currently working on the Unix System Interface. 

To get a better understanding of my coding abilities, I recommend that you start from chapter 8, and go back, since there is alot that I improved on as I progressed.
