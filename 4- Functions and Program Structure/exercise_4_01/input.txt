President Biden and his aides mounted an all-out effort on Wednesday to salvage
the Mr. Bidenâ€™s economic agenda in Congress, attempting to forge even the beginnings of
a compromise between moderates and progressives on a pair of bills that would spend
trillions to rebuild infrastructure, expand access to education, fight climate change and more.
Mr. Biden canceled a scheduled trip to Chicago, where he was planning to promote Covid-19
vaccinations, in order to continue talking with lawmakers during a critical week of deadlines
in the House. One crucial holdout vote in the Senate, Kyrsten Sinema, a centrist from Arizona,
was set to visit the White House on Wednesday morning, a person familiar with the meeting said.
